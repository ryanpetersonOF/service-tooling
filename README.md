        - createConfig: Creates a webpack configuration
        - versionPlugin: Replaces 'PACKAGE_VERSION' constant in source files with the current version of the service
        - manifestPlugin: Provider temporarily requires an extra plugin to override index.html within provider app.json

## Roadmap
This is a WIP as services continue to evolve.

### Usage
An in-depth usage guide and additional documentation will be published in due course.

## Getting Started

Install as a node module to your existing service project.

### Setup

- After installing, add a script to your projects package.json with the command: `svc-tools start` 
- In your webpack.config.js, import `openfin-service-tooling` - this will expose the common webpack utils to create configurations and export.

You can then invoke `svc-tools start` added previously to build and serve your project.

### Startup
Once dependencies are installed and imported, you can invoke `svc-tools start` to build and serve your project.
